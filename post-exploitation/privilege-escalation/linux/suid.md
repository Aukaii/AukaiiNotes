# Suid

A good practice would be to compare executables on this list with GTFOBins. Clicking on the SUID button will filter binaries known to be exploitable when the SUID bit is set (you can also use this link for a pre-filtered list) .

```
#Check if files have SUID or SGID bit set
find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null

#files with the SUID bit set and owned by the root user
find / -user root -perm /4000 2>/dev/null

#files with excessively open permissions
find / type f -perm 777 2>/dev/null

#all files with the SUID bit set
find / -perm -u=s 2>/dev/null
```
